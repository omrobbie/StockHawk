### User Review

1. Hellen says:

   "Right now I can't use this app with my screen reader. My friends love it, so I would love to download it, but the buttons don't tell my screen reader what they do."
   
2. Your boss says:

   "We need to prepare Stock Hawk for the Egypt release. Make sure our translators know what to change and make sure the Arabic script will format nicely."
   
3. Adebowale says:

   "Stock Hawk allows me to track the current price of stocks, but to track their prices over time, I need to use an external program. It would be wonderful if you could show more detail on a stock, including its price over time."

4. Gundega says:

   "I use a lot of widgets on my Android device, and I would love to have a widget that displays my stock quotes on my home screen."
   
5. Jamal says:

   "I found a bug in your app. Right now when I search for a stock quote that doesn't exist, the app crashes."
   
6. Xaio-lu says:

   "When I opened this app for the first time without a network connection, it was a confusing blank screen. I would love a message that tells me why the screen is blank or whether my stock quotes are out of date."
